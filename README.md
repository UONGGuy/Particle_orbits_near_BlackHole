# Particle_orbits_near_BlackHole

Contains scripts used to explore the motion of a particle or photon in the Schwarzschild solution of the Einstein field equations. 

## Overview of repository
- `orbits_interactive_notebook.ipynb`: iPython notebook containing updated take on modelling orbits near black holes using SciPy. Includes visualisations and context.
- `GRPhoton_MATLAB`: Original MATLAB code created to explore the Schwarzschild solution. Includes code for numerical Runge-Kutta 4-th order routines (RK4).
- `CATAM_Manual_PartII.pdf`: Booklet containing initial exploration prompts (see project 14.1)
